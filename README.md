# Simple CRUD RESTful API

Hi everyone,

This is a basic CRUD RESTful API made with Java, MySQL, SpringBoot, JPA and Maven.

I used mysql-connector-java of version 8.0.25.

This API does:
 -Shows the users
 -Save a user to the database
 -Update a user from the database with the given id
 -Delete a user from the database with the given id

Thanks.
